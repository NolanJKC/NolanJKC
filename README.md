## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

1. Nolan Corr	NolanC2001@gmail.com

2. I created this GitHub account for school purposes. Specifically for Wake Tech University. I intend to use it for future tasks involving GitHub.

3. I created the repository known as NolanJKC. It's named after my first name, followed by my full initials. Currently, it does not contain any files other than this README file.

4. I opened up the "Clone Repository" option in GitHub Desktop, and then selected the NolanJKC repository. After selecting the location I wished to store the files on my computer, I hit the "Clone Repository" button.
