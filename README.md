## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

1. Nolan Corr	NolanC2001@gmail.com

2. I created this GitHub account for school purposes. Specifically for Wake Tech University. I intend to use it for future tasks involving GitHub.

3. I created the repository known as NolanJKC. It's named after my first name, followed by my full initials. Currently, it does not contain any files other than this README file.

4. I opened up the "Clone Repository" option in GitHub Desktop, and then selected the NolanJKC repository. After selecting the location I wished to store the files on my computer, I hit the "Clone Repository" button.

# About Me
## My Interests
	* My primary interests include video games, miniature war games, and Table-Top-Role-Playing-Games. I was actually going to Wake Tech for a degree in game development, before deciding to switch to a different degree. I enjoy all kinds of video games and still find myself looking into the field of game development. Perhaps I will make it into a hobby.
## Websites I recommend
	* [Games Workshop] (https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/home)
	** This is the home website for Games Workshop, the company behind Warhammer. Warhammer is a game I play _pretty_ often these days.
	* [Dungeons & Dragons Beyond] (https://www.dndbeyond.com/how-to-play-dnd)
	** This is a how-to website for getting started with Dungeons & Dragons. Dungeons and Dragons is a classic Table-Top RPG that has been around for about **50** years.
